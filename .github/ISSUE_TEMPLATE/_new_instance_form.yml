        Before beginning on the new instance configuration process, you may want to find out if your municipality uses Legistar for it's legislation and meeting management process. If so, this instance configuration process can be almost entirely automated. If not, you will need to write a custom event scraper. See our documentation on the process [here](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/cdp-scrapers).


        Additionally, please refer to our documentation on the [cost of maintaining a CDP instance](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/cookiecutter-cdp-deployment#cost) and affirm that you are able to pay the estimated monthly cost of a new CDP instance.


        Fill out the following information to start the process for deploying a new CDP instance.


        _**Note**, this instance will live under the "CouncilDataProject" GitHub organization and will be hosted under the "councildataproject.org" domain._
